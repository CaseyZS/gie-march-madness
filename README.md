# gie-march-madness
Repository for people to submit to the March Madness code challenge.

The G Idea Exchange committe is proud to host the inaugural March Madness Square Battle event.  The intention of the event is to raise money to support the creation or further development of LabVIEW (G Language) open source projects.  You can learn more about how to submit an idea or donate to a current idea at https://gie.gcentral.org.  All funds generated from this event will be used to support currently active projects.  You can reach out to gie@gcentral.org to provide feedback or volunteer.

For this challenge, the GIE will be using the Square Battle project as created by Derrick Bommarito and available through the VI Package Manager.  You can search for "SoL SquareBattle".  It currently requires LabVIEW 2020 or higher.  The tournament will be played using LabVIEW 2020 32-bit.  If you wish to participate and don't have access to a copy of LabVIEW, you may use the LabVIEW Community Edition (https://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview/select-edition/labview-community-edition.html).

To register for the GIE March Madness Square Battle event, plese visit the following website (TBD). 
The final day to register and submit squares will be March 24th at 8pm Central Time in the US.
